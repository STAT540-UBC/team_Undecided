## Applying Weighted Differential Co-expression Analysis to Characterize Th2 High and Low Asthma Endotypes

Asthma, a disease characterized by chronic inflammation, affects over 235 million individuals worldwide.1 One way to define asthma populations is by T helper cell cytokine levels: patients can have high or low levels of Th2 cytokines. Th2-high patients tend to show more severe symptoms.2 Fortunately, gene expression biomarkers CLCA1, periostin, and serpinB2 have been shown to differentiate the asthma endotypes.2 Our goal is to better characterize differences between the endotypes using a network based approach. Using publicly available data, we present the application of differential co-expression analysis using the transcriptomic and methylation profiles of asthmatic and control patients. Our method first identifies pairs of differentially expressed and methylated genes to subsequently investigate changes in the interactome between endotypes. Assessing pairwise differential interactions between genes may lend more insight into the disease etiology than differential expression alone.
