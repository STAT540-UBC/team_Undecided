**Important**
This folder does contain code relevant to the final project. I didnt want to completely delete them, cause they contain code I will refer to later.

We didnt end up using Limma for RNA-Seq, WGCNA, or Pathway Entrichment, but I would still like to leave this here in case I need it again or work on this project further.
